/* 
GENERAL IDEA:
THIS PROGRAM CHECKS WHETHER THE MEDICAL CLAIMS AND FACILITY CLAIMS ARE DISJOINT.
SPECIFICALLY, IF A ROW IN MEDICAL CLAIM HAS LOC_CD = 1 (FROM FACILITY) HAS A NONTRIVIAL PROC_CD (NE 000000), AND IF THAT PROC_CD APPEARS IN FACILITY CLAIM, THEN OUTPUT. WE ONLY CHECK THIS FOR HCPCS CODES FOR CHEMO DRUG AND CPT CODES FOR SMOKING TO SAVE RUNNING TIME. WE ALSO ONLY LOOK AT PATIENTS WITH NON-MISSING INDEX VTE DATE FROM MEMBER DATA SET, AND RECORDS WITH SERVICE DATE PRIOR TO INDEX VTE. 
*/

1. Read in and concatenate patient information from medical data sets and facility data sets: patid, fst_dt, proc_cd, and "medical" or "facility" as source.

2. Keep rows with procedures before index VTE date, which comes from member data. 

3. Extract HCPCS codes or CPT codes for either chemo procedures, to identify active cancer, or smoking, to calculate Table 1 statistics.

The output data set is used in the subsetting process.

/* 
GENERAL IDEA:

B. FIND THE INDEX CANCER: THE FIRST CANCER OCCURRENCE AMONG ALL CANCER DIAGNOSIS; CANCER DIAGNOSES COME FROM MEDICAL AND CONFINEMENT.

C. EXCLUDE PATIENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE CANCER: NO HCPCS/NDC AFTER THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND PRIOR TO INDEX VTE.
 - HCPCS CODES COME FROM MEDICAL AND FACILITY. NDC CODES COME FROM MEDICAL AND PHARMA.

D. CHECK FOR DUPLICATES: 
  1) IF A PATIENT HAD TWO RECORDS ON THE SAME DATE FOR THE SAME AC, THEN KEEY ONLY
  ONE OF THEM.
  2) IF A PATIENT GOT WARFARIN AND LMWH ON THE SAME DATE, THEN ONLY
  KEEP THE ROW FOR WARFARIN AND REMOVE THE ROW FOR LMWH. OUTPUT THESE TO A NO_DUP 
  DATA SET.

ADDITIONAL STEP: 
- INCLUDE PLANID TO THE FINAL OUTPUT DATASET
*/;



*** A. EXCLUDE PATIENTS EVER GOT ANTI-COAGULANT WITHIN 90~5 DAYS PRIOR TO INDEX VTE DATE ***
1. Read in datasets:
(1) Concatenate PHARMA data from 2007-2016 into a dataset called PHARM, extracting: patid, copay, fill_dt (renamed to fst_dt to match the fst_dt in MEDICAL), quantity, strength (i.e. dosage), ndc. 
(2) Read in MEMBER data into a dataset called MEMBER, extracting: patid, index_dt.

2. Add index_dt from MEMBER to PHARM by matching patid, and this newly created dataset is called PATINFO1, which includes patid, copay, fst_dt, ndc, index_dt.

The resulting dataset is called FINAL1, containing patid, copay, fst_dt, ndc, index_dt.



*** B. FIND THE INDEX CANCER: THE FIRST CANCER OCCURRENCE AMONG ALL CANCER DIAGNOSIS ***
4. Read in datasets:
(1) Read in medical data from 2007-2016 into a dataset called MED, extracting: patid, copay, diag1-diag25, fst_dt, ndc, proc_cd. Only patients who appear in FINAL1 are included in MED
(2) Read in ICD9 codes for cancers
(3) Read in confinement data from 2007-2016 into a dataset called MED, extracting: patid, copay, diag1-diag5, fst_dt, proc_cd. Only patients who appear in FINAL1 are included in FAC
(4) Merge information from MED and FAC.

5. Find index cancer date and type: 
(1) Use array to check for cancer diagnosis in each row, and store diagnosis number and count the number of cancer diagnoses
(2) Calculate the total cancer diagnoses for each patient and keep those with at least one total cancer diagnosis
(3) Among patients with at least one cancer diagnosis, obtain the date of the first cancer diagnosis as the index cancer date: index_cancer_dt = min(fst_dt); and store the ICD9 codes for index cancer(s) in a string: index_cancer_code
(4) Convert ICD codes into cancer categories: 
	i. Transform data from wide to long: one index_cancer_code per row
	ii. Keep rows with distinct patid and index_cancer_code
	iii. Add cancer category as a new variable cancer_type, based on each index_cancer_code from dataset ICD_CODE
	iv. Keep rows with distinct patid and cancer_type
	v. Transform data from long to wide: one row of cancer_type per patid


*** C. EXCLUDE PATIENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE CANCER ***
6. Keep patients with an active chemo procedure before index VTE date:
(1) Read in "..\data\check_2_proccd.xlsx" where the rows correpond to a chemo procedure
(2) Add index VTE date and keep rows where fst_dt is between index cancer date and index VTE date

7. Keep patients with an active chemo drug before index VTE date: keep rows with index_cancer <= fst_dt <= index_dt, and (ndc is a chemo drug)

8. Keep distinct patid of those who had an active cancer. The resulting dataset is called FINAL2


*** D. CHECK FOR DUPLICATES: MERGE INFORMATION AND OBTAIN AC CATEGORY ***
9. Merge FINAL1 and FINAL2 by selecting patients who appear in both data sets. The resulting dataset is called SEMIFINAL

10. Add index cancer information (index_cancer, index_cancer_type) to SEMIFINAL

11. Output FINAL.

12. For each patid, remove rows with the same values in AC generic name, copay, quantity, and strength on the same date. Output to NO_DUP
